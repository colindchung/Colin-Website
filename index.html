                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Hey! My name is Colin and this is website is dedicated to my personal projects. My projects range from web development to IoT circuits to hand-crafted wooden puzzles. I was first introduced to programming when I was in the 7th grade when I joined a First Robotics team. Since then, code has intrigued me and I have taken many computer science courses and worked several types of tasks for tech companies. Through my experience, I have developed several projects in many different programming languages. I also picked up Arduino and woodworking in middle school which continue to spark my interest. I created this website to showcase my learning over the years and my passion for designing and writing interesting products.</p>

                <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
                <p>Most of my other hobbies are sports related. Since most of the skills i need for school and employment are intellectual, I enjoy hobbies such as woodworking, circuits, sports and activities where I use my hands and body. I've played tennis at my local club since I was 6 years old. I never competed in organized tournaments, but I loved it so much that I became a coach for 5 years. I represented my school in grades 9, 10, and 11, and I even qualified for the provincial championships one year. The other sport I have come to love is basketball. I am a die hard San Antonio Spurs fan, and watching them motivated me to start playing basketball in highschool. I represented our varsity team as a shooting guard in my senior year. One of my favourite hobbies when I am alone is riding my bike through the city. I love exploring new pockets of my hometown, zooming down hills and feeling the breeze in my face.</p>

                <h3>Best Projects</h3>
                <p>I really like learning new languages and platforms by doing projects, which is why most of my projects are relatively small and simple. I enjoy keeping projects quick so I can learn more languages and develop a strong technical base. With that being said, I have made a couple projects which I am specifically proud of. Please feel free to check out the highlights of all my projects on this website. I hope to continue to add to this list throughout my entire degree. Here are shortcuts to some of my favourite projects at the moment:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="src/game.html#othello">Interactive Othello Game</a></li>
                    <li><a href="src/utilities.html#billy">BiLLy Receipt Management</a></li>
                    <li><a href="src/utilities.html#math-library">Custom Math Library</a></li>
                    <li><a href="src/wood.html#stack-puzzle">Stack Wood Puzzle</a></li>

                <h3>What's in the Works?</h3>
                <h4 class="sub">This Website!</h4>
                <p>This website is certainly still in progress. I made it to showcase my projects, but I'd like to ramp it up a bit. As of now, there are no complex moving parts. I'd like to migrate it to run using AngularJS and add animations. And of course, add more projects!</p>
                <h4 class="sub">Games</h4>
                <p>Since I started programming, I always enjoyed making games. I think it's because I enjoy creating algorithms and creating something that I can enjoy testing. While I don't hate designing a user interface, I definitely prefer writing the back-end logical code to carry out various tasks. Ever since I created Othello as part of a summative project, I have envisioned creating a platform (maybe even a website) linked to multiple strategic games all built using different technolgies.</p>
                <h4 class="sub">BiLLy</h4>
                <p>BiLLy was one of my hackathon projects built with several peers. We used this opportunity to learn a lot about different stacks, and so we did not complete all aspects of our idea in the alloted time. I discuss more about the features we are planning to add in the <a href="src/utilities.html#billy">product description</a>.</p>
                <h4 class="sub">What Am I Learning?</h4>
                <p>There's so much to learn in tech, so where do I even start? I am becoming comfortable with Object Oriented languages, and I feel like I can learn new language syntax relatively quickly. My main focus in the near future is to master some IoT and hardware design languages, as well as learn more about the back-end. Luckily for me, I am enrolled in several circuits courses, including labs where I am programming an FPGA with VDHL and Verilog. I also enjoy using Arduino as a platform for simple projects. As for the back-end, I'd like to master the art of building and using APIs, creating stored procs, and using different database technologies and platforms (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, NoSQL, Oracle). Hopefully by the time I graduate, I'll have gained plenty of experience from my elective courses, co-op terms and personal projects!</p>
