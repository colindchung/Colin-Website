                <p>Hey! My name is Colin and this is an overview of all my personal projects. My projects range from web development to IoT circuits to hand-crafted wooden puzzles. I was first introduced to programming when I was in the 7th grade when I joined a First Robotics team. Since then, code has intrigued me and I have taken many computer science courses and worked several types of tasks for tech companies. Through my experience, I have developed several projects in many different programming languages. I also picked up Arduino and woodworking in middle school which continue to spark my interest. I created this website to showcase my learning over the years and my passion for designing and writing interesting products.</p>
