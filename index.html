                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Hey! My name is Colin and this is website is dedicated to my personal projects. My projects range from web development to IoT circuits to hand-crafted wooden puzzles. I was first introduced to programming when I was in the 7th grade when I joined a First Robotics team. Since then, code has intrigued me and I have taken many computer science courses and worked several types of tasks for tech companies. Through my experience, I have developed several projects in many different programming languages. I also picked up Arduino and woodworking in middle school which continue to spark my interest. I created this website to showcase my learning over the years and my passion for designing and writing interesting products.</p>

                <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
                <p>Most of my other hobbies are sports related. Since my schooling and work experience in the industry is mostly intellectual, I enjoy hobbies such as woodworking, Arduino and sports where I use my hands. I've played tennis at my local club since I was 6 years old. I never competed in organized tournaments, but I loved it so much that I became a coach for 5 years. I represented my school in grades 9, 10, and 11, and I even qualified for the provincial championships one year. The other sport I have come to love is basketball. I am a die hard San Antonio Spurs fan, as they motivated me to start playing basketball in highschool. I represented our varsity team as a shooting guard in my senior year. One of my favourite hobbies when I am alone is riding my bike through the city. I love exploring new pockets of my hometown, zooming down hills and feeling the breeze in my face.</p>

                <h3>Best Projects</h3>
                <p>I really like learning new languages and platforms by doing projects, which is why most of my projects are relatively small and simple. I enjoy keeping projects quick so I can learn more languages and develop a strong technical base. With that being said, I have made a couple projects which I am specifically proud of. Please feel free to check out the highlights of all my projects on this website. I hope to continue to add to this list throughout my entire degree. Here are shortcuts to some of my favourite projects at the moment:</p>
