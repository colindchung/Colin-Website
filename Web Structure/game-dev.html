                <p class="description">For a Grade 12 final project, I recreated the game of Othello (Also known as Reversi). It started with the algorithms to simulate the game in the console output using simple key commands. Afterwards, I integrated JavaFX for user-friendly controls and then I added computer bots to play single player using mulitple difficulty levels.</p>

                <p class="description">The board is represented as an 8x8 2D array, showed above left. A black piece is denoted by a 'B', a white piece by 'W', and an empty tile by '*'. The game is initialized by creating an empty board and overwriting the middle 4 tiles with the appropriate tiles. The algorithms are carried out user helper functions which:</p>
                <ul class="description">
                    <li>Check if the game is over</li>
                    <li>Verify if a move is valid</li>
                    <li>Count how many tiles are flipped by a proposed move</li>
                    <li>Perform a move</li>
                    <li>Decide which move the computer makes</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../Images/Othello/gameboard.png">
                <p class="description">I integrated a UI using the JavaFX library. Each tile is a button which calls the algorithm helper functions to perform a move, if legal. At the bottom of the screen is a self-updating scoreboard display which shows how many tiles each player has on the board and a red dot indicating which player's turn it is.</p>
